# BBB-Wifi-Radio
Internet Radio based on the Beaglebone Black platform made by Jorge Garcia

This repository contains the hardware and software files I created in order to make a Wifi Radio using the Beaglebone Black
single board computer.

This Radio use a Python-Tkinter interface to communicate with MPC and MPD in order to play internet radio stations. In th
various folders you will find further information about what each of the files contains and what their purpose is in the
scheme of the project.

If you have any questions please feel free to contact me, jorge@cadsoftusa.com or call 954-237-0932.

I would like to extend a special thanks to Shabaz from the Element14 community and Robert C Nelson, William Hermans, and
Peter Gregory from the Beagleboard Groups forum. Without their help and insight this project would never have been completed.
